Fm-QCA (Fully functional multiple-valued QCA)
======
QCA(Qualitative Comparative Analysis) is an analysis method for scholars who aim at qualitative research and deal with small-N cases. Several softwares are available including fs/QCA, Mv/QCA but when it refers to multiple-valued field, some limitations exist. So, we developed this tool named Fm-QCA to make it easy for handling mv-QCA data.

Fm-QCA is guided by Shiping Tang who is a distinguished professon in Fudan university and developed by a technical team in ECNU.

This software is open for all the scholars. If you have any sugesstions, just send mail to fm_qca@126.com
